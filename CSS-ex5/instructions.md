# Flexbox

A powerful tool for CSS layouts is the flexbox. This is a display type like `block` or `inline` that will automatically size elements for a container element to take up as much or as little space as you'd like. Element sizes are calculated and the flexbox will then figure out how to distribute the _remaining_ space for the container. This is a powerful layout tool that you'll use moving forward.

## Reading

[CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) is a fantastic site to reference CSS techniques. Rather than give detailed information here on flexbox, look over their [guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) because it is probably the best one on the Internet. 

Start with the [basics and terminology](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-basics-and-terminology) section because it will orient you to the box model and how it applies in this new context.

When you've finished reading that section, move on to [flexbox properties](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-flexbox-properties) and take time to read about the parent (flex-container) element. Then, look over the child (flex-item) properties. The goal with this reading is to form a model in your mind for the role of the parent and the roles of the items.

## Assignment

The attached template has a basic HTML content structure. Your goal is to have it match the layout described. Each section will require you to apply a specific technique in the flexbox paradigm. You will need to go back and reference the guide while you're working. You can use any class or ID attributes you would like to achieve your layout.

Here are your assignment tasks:

1. Create a right-aligned `nav` menu with items aligned in the center.
2. A content container with two evenly spaced blocks of text.
3. A content container with three evenly spaced blocks of text.
