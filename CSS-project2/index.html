                    What are drivers?

                <p>
                    A graphics driver is a program that controls how a computer's graphics card interacts with the rest of the computer.

                    What do they do?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Graphics drivers translate digital code into images, videos, and pictures that appear on the computer screen.

                    How do they work?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Graphics drivers act as a communication bridge between the computer's software and hardware. They provide instructions to the graphics card, which is a physical component that renders images on the screen.

                    Why are they important
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Graphics drivers are essential for using a computer's graphics card to play games and view other content. Outdated or faulty graphics drivers can cause issues like laggy gameplay, low-quality graphics, and crashes.
