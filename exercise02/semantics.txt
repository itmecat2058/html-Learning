Web pages have semantic structure to help convey meaning. The attached template has a recipe for some hummus that _looks_ structured to our eyes, but the compter cannot "see" that structure.

Open up this page in your browser to see how it displays.

HTML tags allow the client to correctly interpret the document structure for the user. Hierarchical tags (<h1> - <h6>, <ol>, <ul>, and <p>) give meaning to the text on the page. There are visual cues, like headings being larger, but they also provide meaning to assistive technology like screen readers. 

In addition to paragraph and heading tags, you'll need to create and use lists. Lists are either _ordered_ (ol) or _unordered_ (ul). Regardless of which kind of list you're using, all items within that list are called _list items (<li>).
In this exercise, you need to add the correct heirarchical tags to the document so that, when rendered, it has the correct semantic display. For each tag you use, add a comment above (<!-- your comment -->) explaining why you chose the tag you used.
