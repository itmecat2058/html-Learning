    <p>
      This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing around. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pittabreads.

    <h4>
      Ingredients
    </h4> 

    <ul>
      <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
      <li>175g of tahini</li>
      <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
      <li>Half a red pepper</li>
      <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li> 
      <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
      <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
      Instructions
    </h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
      <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
      <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li> 
      <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste. If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time. If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time. </li>
      <li>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure oflemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Storage</h4>

   <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able touse it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy,you should definitely discard it. Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
